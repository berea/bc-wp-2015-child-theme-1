<h1>NO TUITION PROMISE</h1>

<p>Berea is the only one of America’s top colleges that awards every enrolled student a no-tuition promise.</p>

<p>No student pays for tuition.</p>

<p>Our generous TUTITION PROMISE SCOLARSHIP makes it possible for you to graduate debt-free. Even if you borrow for special learning opportunites or to replace your family’s total contribution, you will have a low debt compared to national trends. We sometimes call Berea "the best education money can’t buy."</p>
